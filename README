= Vimconfig

This is my personal vim config, it uses 'pathogen' + 'git submodules' to manage
the different plugins that are installed and being used. 

== Folder Structure

1) autoload/

This folder will contain only the pathogen extension, that will allow to manage 
the vim plugins without to much hassle

2) bundle/

All the plugins are installed here as git submodules, in order to make the
plugins work after clone, you should do:

git submodule init
git submodule update

NOTE: the vimproc extension *will require* to compile a makefile contained on
the plugin folder in order to make it work. 
For more info check => :help vimproc

3) colors/

This folder will hold all the different colorschemes I've found so far over the
webz the default one for terminal is wombat256, and the one for gvim is sunburst.

4) modules/

This folder will contain all the basic setup of the plugins, organized by a different
file for each of the plugins that is being configured, there is also some files that 
configure the basics of vim.

5) tmp/

A folder that will hold temporal metadata for the installed plugins
